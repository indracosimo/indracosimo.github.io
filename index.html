<div id="about">
  <p>Oh hey, what's goin' on? My name is Indra and I live in Stockholm, Sweden.<br>
     I am a game programmer however my passion for games lie in design,
     one of my favorite aspect of development is discussing what the game is going to be and how design decisions influence each other.<br> 
     When it comes to playing games or discussing projects I feel like I have a good eye for mechanics, gameloops that play into each other and how to make something fun and interesting.<br>
     Solving problems is something that I really enjoy, even if I don't look like I'm having fun at first!<br>
     Some of the best experiences of working in a team is the shared feeling of joy once a seemingly impossible task is overcome.<br>
     My dream is to have my own studio where I can be more of a game director, when it comes to game development and programming I see myself as a bit of an all-arounder, <br> I think my biggest strength is recognizing the individual strengths of my teammates, as well as the ability to keep everyone on the same page.<br>
     Breaking a problem down into smaller bite-sized chunks is the best way to code and manage!
  </P>
